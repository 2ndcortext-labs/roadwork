name: roadwork-help
description: Answers questions about the road plans without acting — with no argument, the map (the lifecycle in a paragraph, the skills in order with one line each, where things are); with a skill name, an item reference or a glossary term, that one thing, read live from docs/teachme.md, the skills' glossaries and the register, never from memory. Use when the user says /roadwork-help, "what does X do", "where is X", "what is a Y", "help me with the road plans". Writes nothing; offers the item's next skill when given an item.

# roadwork-help — the map, or one thing, read live

Roadwork conventions: this skill's glossary; in a workspace, its rules file as well. This skill sits
beside the lifecycle chain, not in it: it never files, interviews,
writes or builds. It reads and answers. Its sources are the teach-me
(`docs/teachme.md` in the register),
the glossary every lifecycle skill carries, and the register itself —
read at the call, never from memory.

## 1. Resolve the argument

A batch (`ref && ref`) is refused here: one thing at a time.

Read the argument in this order, first match wins:

- **none** — the map of §2.
- **a reference** — it contains `/` (`todo/<item-name>`, `feature/<item-name>`,
  `spark/<item-name>`, `main/<kind>/<item-name>`):
  the item of §3.
- **a skill name** — a folder of that name among the skills, with or
  without the leading `/`: the skill of §3.
- **a term** — a glossary entry of that name (case-insensitive) in the
  lifecycle skills' glossary: the term of §3.
- **anything else** — one line: "not found: `<argument>` is not a
  reference, a skill or a glossary term", then what this skill takes,
  then stop.

## 2. The map

Print: the lifecycle in one paragraph, in the teach-me's words; the
skills in order, one line each — its invocation and what it does; then
where things are — the folders of the register (the three
sub-registers, `archive/`, `docs/`, `destinations/`, `maps/`), `ordering.md`,
`working.md`. Every line comes from the teach-me's section of that name
or the skill's own description line, read at the call.

## 3. One thing

- **A skill**: its description line (its purpose), what it takes, and
  the offers it ends with — read from its `SKILL.md`; the teach-me's
  line on it.
- **An item**: its state — the kind, the status line of its
  item file, `intent.md` accepted or not, `spec.md` accepted or not,
  `in-process`, the gates met per `GATES.md` when one exists, what blocks
  it — and the next skill it is ready for, by the states of
  `/roadwork-ingest` §5b; read from the item's files.
- **A term**: the glossary entry, verbatim, and the teach-me's paragraph
  that explains it, when one does.

Say "not found" as §1 when the item, skill or term does not exist; never
invent a state.

## 4. Sources — live, never memory

Every answer names the file it was read from, in one trailing line
("read from: …"). The teach-me is read from the register's `docs/`
(`docs/teachme.md`); the glossary from the skill's own file; an item from
its folder; a skill from its `SKILL.md`. Nothing is answered from what
the session agent remembers.

## 5. Hand back

Writes nothing — no file, no line in any register. When the argument was
an item, end with one offer, the next skill that item is ready for, as
one invocation in its own code block preceded by its sentence (offer
form), never invoked. Otherwise no offer. As a checkbox list where the harness has a question tool, blocks otherwise (the glossary's **Offer form** entry). No back offers: this skill
interrupts nothing.

## Never

Never write; never file, interview, spec, build or archive; never answer
from memory; never invent a state — say "not found"; never a second
question; never open a PR.

**Text for the Operator.** In text for the Operator, use the plain words of the terms table — `docs/terms.md` in the register, one row per term: the plain word, the agent's word, the meaning; the agent's words stay in the skill.

## Glossary

- **Roadwork** — the Roadwork system by 2nd Cortex Labs — road plans and the skills that work them.
- **Road plans** — the project's `roadwork/`: the one place its work is recorded. Three **sub-registers**: `todo/` (fixes, chores, decisions, findings), `feature/` (new capabilities), `spark/` (ideas; never worked); the test: a todo is done once, a feature is reused when built — the Operator may name the kind against it.
- **Item** — one folder under its destination's folder in a sub-register (`unnavigated/` until a navigation cites it): `todo.md` or `feature.md` (the **item file**) plus `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`; a spark holds only `idea.md`.
- **Home** — the register an item lives in: the project's one register, at the path the project's law names; a clone of a remote, fetched and merged, never pushed.
- **Reference (ref)** — `todo/<item-name>`, `feature/<item-name>`, `spark/<item-name>`; from anywhere, `main/<kind>/<item-name>` — the project's law may alias the prefix.
- **Frontmatter** — the YAML block opening an item file: `blocker`, `blocking`, `blocked-by`, `external`, `group`, `in-process`, `disposition`, `road-level` (the item's level within its destination — `main`, `secondary`, `side` — or empty), a feature's `onroad-cohort` before it.
- **`ordering.md`** — the register's loose priority list; top is next. **`working.md`** — the register's dated list of items in process.
- **Operator (user)** — the human owner; every decision is theirs.
- **Session agent** — the agent running the session that invokes the skill.
- **Project scope** — everything at and under the root the project's law names; the paths an item touches are its **Paths:** line.
- **Batch** — the coherent bundle a project's changes ship in as one PR; the register's own commits are local and never a PR.
- **Lifecycle** — `/roadwork-destination` → `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` (a destination into a group) → `/roadwork-ingest` → `/roadwork-intentify` → `/roadwork-specplan` → `/roadwork-make` (the only go; builds under `/unlazy`) → `/roadwork-verify-and-archive`. Every skill ends by offering the next. Beside the chain, `/roadwork-help` answers.
- **PRD** — a product requirements document, `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`, made by `/roadwork-destination` and the source of a group of items made by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; cited by path in every derived item.
- **Destination** — one `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`: what is wanted, in a fixed form (a frontmatter block with `bucket-list-priority`, 1–10, 10 the highest; the destination, numbered requirements, Out, Success); its slug categorises the register's items — one destination per item, the group's, written on the item by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; archived to `destinations/archive/` by hand when built.
- **Map** — one `maps/<map-slug>.md`: a primitive of the way to a destination — before agents, process, tools, judgements, inputs — in a fixed form, made by `/roadwork-map`; named on an item by its **Map:** line, one per item, read by `/roadwork-intentify` and `/roadwork-specplan`; a pattern to follow or improve, enforced by nothing; retired to `maps/archive/` by hand.
- **Sanity todo** — the todo `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` creates last, `todo/<destination-slug>-sanity`: the group list and the requirement↔item mapping both ways; blocks every other item in the group until the Operator says the group is right.
- **Check types** — the six sanity checks `/roadwork-navsanity` runs over a group: completeness, provenance, shape, dependencies, order, scope.
- **Run** — one pass of `/roadwork-navsanity` over a group: six checks, ten questions, the changes made; recorded as a dated section in the group's sanity todo.
- **Hand-made group** — a group not born of a PRD; its requirements are its members' own claims plus the group's line in `ordering.md`.
- **Cohort** — a subgroup of a group's features that can be built in parallel by sub-agents: the rubric passes on every criterion; named in each member's `onroad-cohort`.
- **Cohortmeister (CM)** — `feature/cm-<group>-<cohort>`: the pseudo-feature that blocks a cohort's members, is onroaded in their place, and whose ledger is the results checker; archives them by cascade.
- **Rubric** — the five pass/fail criteria a subgroup must meet to be a cohort: no dependency edge, disjoint ownership, accepted spec and plan with gates, no external and not in process, self-contained builds.
- **Reconsideration** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s second mode: on an item whose accepted spec and plan already exist, re-read them against everything dated since; a dated `Reconsidered` changelog, proven gates carried, the previous go ended, the spec proposed again.
- **Verification round** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s fresh-eyes check: five predefined questions on the spec, four on the plan, one fresh reader each — run as one workflow where the harness runs workflows, on the top model of the tier one step below the session's (or the session's own where no lower tier exists) at an effort the dispatcher sets, findings in one bounded shape (file, line, one sentence, an empty disposition slot; at most eight; "clean" as none), sub-agents the fallback — findings incorporated or rejected with a reason and recorded in the document by the session agent; one round per document.
- **Back offers** — the second offer line of the four interrupting skills: up to five open lifecycle steps in flight, most recent first, read from the road plans; offers, never invocations; each preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does.
- **Item name** — the kebab-case folder name of an item, chosen at ingest in the Operator's words, and its reference (`todo/<item-name>`, `main/<kind>/<item-name>`); never reused; never a skill name. "Slug" is a generic word, not the register's term; the register names one, a destination's `<destination-slug>`.
- **Batch invocation** — one skill, many references on one line, separated by ` && `; accepted by `/roadwork-verify-and-archive` and `/roadwork-make`, and by `/roadwork-ingest` for a spark batch only (sparks of one home, converting into one item — the bare `/roadwork-spark` lists them grouped), refused by the rest with a reason; offers are printed as invocations in code blocks, related ones combined.
- **Bare call** — a lifecycle skill invoked with no argument lists instead of acting — `/roadwork-spark` the open sparks grouped for conversion, `/roadwork-destination` the destinations with their navigation state, `/roadwork-make` the make-eligible items with their goes and the ineligible with their reasons; a bare call writes nothing.
- **Offer form** — every command or phrase a reply suggests the Operator type is printed in its own fenced code block (three backticks, no language tag), nothing else in the block, one per block, so it copies in one gesture; invocations that run as one line — a batch invocation with ` && ` — share one block; prose around the block says what it does; an offered invocation is preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does. The copy a skill carries for use outside a workspace; in a workspace the reply-form rule holds it. Where the harness has a question tool, the offers of a hand-back are one list of choices — each the invocation with its sentence — plus "none of these" and a free-text choice; a tick is the Operator's word, run in the same turn; blocks where there is no tool. Where an offer waits on the Operator's word, the block — or the choice's label — carries both, `<word> and <invocation>`; the word is recorded as the Operator's, dated, before the invocation runs.
- **Fact suffix** — after the last offer of a lifecycle hand-back, when the machine's minute is a multiple of six: two blank lines, then the title line "A 2ndcortex/roadmap system detail you should know about:" plain, then one fact from `docs/facts.md`, picked by the seconds modulo the count of its numbered facts — never a heading, then "Typing this explains it:" and `/roadwork-help <term>` in its own code block; never after `/roadwork-help`; no state, no script.
- **Tasksplit** — `/roadwork-tasksplit <source>`: any document or list into a dated group of todos, one per unit the source delineates, the source's words verbatim and no reading added; no sanity todo, no cohort.
