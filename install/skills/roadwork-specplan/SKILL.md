name: roadwork-specplan
description: Under the Operator's spec-writing guidelines (the intent is authoritative; nothing added silently; verification fit to the work), from an accepted intent.md produce the road plans item's spec.md — or, when an accepted spec.md and plan.md already exist, run a reconsideration: re-read them against everything dated since, keep what holds, revise what does not, with a dated changelog and proven gates carried — that is, produce spec.md (requirements and design, constrained by the workspace's skills and law, areas of concern flagged) and plan.md (ordered, dependency-aware, with acceptance gates in the unlazy ledger form). Use when the user says /roadwork-specplan, roadwork-specplan, "spec this", "plan this from the intent", or when an item's intent.md is accepted and its spec.md or plan.md is still a stub.

# roadwork-specplan — from an accepted intent to its spec and plan

A road plans item is a folder of four files: the item (`todo.md` or
`feature.md`), `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md` (Roadwork conventions: this skill's glossary; in a workspace, its rules file as well). `/roadwork-intentify` produces the intent. This
skill takes an **accepted** intent and produces the other two:

- **`spec.md`** — requirements and design: what exactly changes and how
  it is verified, constrained by the skills and law in force, with
  every area of concern flagged for its policy owner. The product
  owner reviews it and does not write it.
- **`plan.md`** — how the spec gets built: ordered, dependency-aware
  steps, each with an acceptance gate in the unlazy ledger form, so the
  plan is testable before anyone builds and the build can run under
  `/unlazy` against it.

Nothing is built here, and accepting the spec does not start the build
either: the Operator starts it, by `/roadwork-make <ref>` (which runs `/unlazy`
against the plan's gates) or by saying "build" in so many words. "Spec
accepted" means the spec is accepted — nothing more.

## 0a. Spec-writing guidelines (Operator, 2026-09-11)

A batch (`ref && ref`) is refused here: one tree at a time — one spec and plan per run.

The standard every spec written by this skill — in either mode — and by
`/roadwork-nav-to-destination` and `/roadwork-subagentifygroup` follows. Verbatim:

update specplan skill to tighten spec writing - some ideas:

Create a bespoke specification from the supplied intent document. The intent document was developed through a thorough process and is the authoritative statement of the desired outcome. Treat its settled decisions as established; do not repeat discovery or reopen them without identifying a specific contradiction, omission, or feasibility concern.
The work may concern any kind of project, deliverable, process, service, or build. Do not assume software, a repository, particular tools, or a particular execution method.
Preserve intent and prevent assumptions

* Faithfully translate the intent into clear requirements, deliverables, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.
* Preserve distinctions between mandatory requirements, preferences, possibilities, and exclusions.
* Do not silently add scope, constraints, implementation choices, dates, budgets, responsibilities, or success measures.
* Distinguish requirements supported by the intent document from your proposed decisions and unresolved questions.
* Where a requirement follows necessarily from the intent, explain that connection. Where multiple reasonable interpretations or approaches exist, do not present one as settled.

Resolve only specification-level gaps
Identify missing decisions that prevent the intent from becoming actionable or verifiable.
For each material gap, explain what is unresolved, why it matters, and your recommendation or meaningful options. Ask focused questions in small batches. Do not ask questions already answered by the intent document.
Continue drafting sections that do not depend on unresolved answers. Clearly mark affected sections as provisional. An unanswered question is not permission to assume.
Leave execution details open when they can safely be decided during the work. State any boundaries those later decisions must respect.
Specify the outcome precisely
Include the sections relevant to this work, such as:

* Intended outcome and relationship to the intent document.
* Deliverables and their required characteristics.
* Scope, exclusions, and constraints.
* Dependencies and interactions with existing work.
* Acceptance criteria and evidence of completion.
* Execution sequence, review points, and handoff requirements where needed.
* Open decisions and blockers.

Use enough detail for someone to carry out the work without inventing consequential requirements. Avoid prescribing methods that the intent does not require unless they are necessary and explicitly agreed upon.
Make verification appropriate to the work
Define how each important requirement will be assessed and what evidence will establish completion.
Use measurements, inspection, demonstrations, reviews, reference examples, or automated checks as appropriate. For qualitative requirements, specify the review criteria and approval authority where established. Do not manufacture numerical thresholds or assume all verification must be automated.
Keep the specification traceable and consistent
Make it possible to trace important requirements to the intent document or a subsequently approved decision. Use section references or a compact mapping when helpful.
Check both directions: every material commitment in the intent must be addressed, and every consequential requirement in the specification must have a supported basis.
If the specification would require changing the intent, surface the proposed change explicitly rather than quietly rewriting the original objective.
Report readiness honestly
Deliver a self-contained specification in a format proportionate to the work. Clearly identify unresolved decisions and whether they block all execution or only a later stage.
Distinguish drafted, approved, and ready for execution. Do not treat drafting as approval.
Your task is to create the specification. Execution requires separate authorization.
Begin by reading the intent document, checking whether it supports an actionable specification, and identifying only the material gaps that remain. If there are no blocking gaps, proceed directly to drafting.

## 0. Preconditions — stop if unmet

Resolve the item as `/roadwork-intentify` does (item name, folder, file, or the
item touched in this session; ask which only if ambiguous). Then:

- `intent.md` exists and its status line reads **accepted** (or the
  user says in this session that it is accepted — record that as the
  acceptance, with date). A draft intent is not a basis for a spec:
  say so, offer `/roadwork-intentify` to finish it, and stop.
- **Which mode.** If `spec.md` and `plan.md` are placeholders, this is
  the first-time mode. If both exist with an accepted status line, this
  is the **reconsideration mode** (a reconsideration run) — say so in the first line of the reply,
  before any file is written, and follow §1b, §3b and the reconsideration
  paragraphs of §2–§4 as well. "Failed onroad as a cohort member is not
  the only origin case" (Operator, 2026-09-11): a failed or abandoned
  build, a cohort revert note, a changed blocker or dependency, an
  amended intent, a navsanity run's cross-notes, or the Operator's
  plain wish to rethink all arrive here the same way.

## 1. Gather — facts are yours, decisions are the owner's

Read the whole folder and everything the intent cites. Then, before
writing a line of spec, assemble the constraints that will bind it:

- **Workspace law**: the workspace's brief (its `CLAUDE.md`), the path-scoped
  rules that match the files the work will touch, the consulted law
  docs the brief points to, the project scope, as the workspace states it.
- **The canon**: the project's canon, consulted generally for anything the work
  does with a remote (PRs, reviews).
- **Skills in force**: list every skill available in this session by
  name with the commit of the tree that provides it (the skills' tree at `HEAD` for
  workspace skills). Each skill that governs an aspect of the work —
  security, compliance, UX, brand, voice, completion discipline — is
  a constraint on the spec and is named in it.
- **The map**: when the item file carries a **Map:** line, read
  `maps/<map-slug>.md` in the register; the plan's steps follow its Process — a
  step that serves a Process step keeps that step's order and names it, a
  step with no counterpart keeps its own place — and the plan names the
  map's Tools. When the item names no map, say so in one line.
- **The codebase**: the files, configs, scripts and records the change
  touches; what other items in `roadwork/todo/` and `roadwork/feature/`
  already claim, and the item's own frontmatter — every `blocked-by` and
  `external` is a concern until cleared, every `blocking` a consumer of
  the spec;
  or depend on. Use sub-agents for breadth; never ask the owner for a
  fact you can read.

Where two constraints contradict, or a constraint cannot be satisfied
by this change, that is an **area of concern**: record it with the
policy's owner (the Operator, the canon's keeper, a named rule) — do not
resolve it silently and do not pick a side.

## 1b. Reconsideration — the evidence

In a reconsideration run, gather besides the law and skills **everything
dated after the spec's acceptance**: the item's `GATES.md` (met, unmet
and abandoned gates with their evidence); a cohort revert note; changes
to `blocked-by`, `blocking`, `external`; an amended `intent.md`;
cross-notes from a navsanity run or other items; the Operator's words
in this session. The list is open-ended; the rule is "anything dated
after the spec". Every piece you rely on is cited in the changelog.

## 2. Write `spec.md`

Replace the stub whole. Form:

```
# Spec: <title from intent.md>
Status: proposed. From: intent.md accepted <date>. Author: the session agent for <owner>.
Skills in force: <name@commit, …>. Law in force: <brief@commit, rules matched>.

## Problem restated
<one paragraph, from the intent, in its terms>

## Requirements
R1. <observable requirement> — satisfies: <intent outcome or constraint>
R2. …
(Every requirement traces to the intent; anything the intent did not
ask for is marked "added — why".)

## Design
<what changes, where: files, folders, records, channels, configs; the
shape of each change; interfaces touched; what is explicitly out>

## Constraints applied
<each skill and law that shaped the design, and how — one line each>

## Areas of concern  ← the owner works these first
C1. <concern> — policy: <which>; owner: <who resolves>; options: <a / b>
C2. …
(Contradicting policies, unsatisfiable constraints, risk the
organization classes as higher than routine. "None" only if true.)

## Open questions
<from intent.md: answered here (say how) or carried forward (say why)>

## Acceptance criteria
A1. <how anyone verifies R1 is met — an observable check>
…
```

Rules: ids and hashes machine-read; dated claims; the owner's words
kept where they decided; no implementation steps (those are the plan).

**Tags.** Every requirement line ends with `[supported: <intent
section>]`, `[proposed]` (your decision) or `[open]` (unresolved), and,
where the intent distinguishes, `(mandatory | preference | possibility |
exclusion)`. Nothing is added silently: no scope, constraint,
implementation choice, date, budget, responsibility or success measure
the intent did not give, unless marked `[proposed]`.

**The optional eighth heading**,
"Execution sequence, review points, handoffs", is written when the work has an order, a review point, or a
handoff between parties that the plan's steps alone would not capture;
state that need in one line under the heading.

**Readiness** on the status line: `proposed (drafted)`; `accepted
(approved)`; `ready for execution` (accepted, no blocking open decision,
the go given). Name which open decisions block all execution and which
only a later stage.

**A settled decision of the intent is reopened only with a named
contradiction, omission, or feasibility concern** — recorded as a
**proposed change to the intent** in the hand-back, never applied in the
spec.

## 2b. Gap round — only when a material gap exists

After the draft, if a specification-level gap remains — a missing
decision that stops the intent being actionable or verifiable — put the
gaps to the Operator as one round in the `/roadwork-intentify` form, closed as `/roadwork-intentify` §2 closes a round: for
each, what is unresolved, why it matters, your recommendation or
options. Never a question the intent already answers. The draft is
written first, with the affected sections marked **provisional**. No
gap, no round. "An unanswered question is not permission to assume."

## 2c. Spec verification round — fresh eyes, once

After the draft (and the gap round if any), dispatch **five fresh
sub-agents in parallel**, one question each, every one given only the
paths of `intent.md` and `spec.md` and its question, with this brief:
"You are a fresh reviewer with no other context. Read these two files:
<paths>. Answer this one question: <question>. Give a numbered list of
findings, each with the file and line it points at; say 'clean' if
none. Do not rewrite anything. Do not read any other file." The five
questions, verbatim:

**Where the harness runs workflows**, the five run as one workflow — one agent per question, given the same two paths and the same brief, each returning its findings in one shape: file, line, one sentence, an empty disposition slot; at most eight; "clean" as none — on the top model of the tier one step below the session's — or the session's own where no lower tier exists — at an effort the dispatching agent sets for the run. The round's record below is still written by the session agent from the run's journal; the dispositions are its own, the journal holds none. Where the harness runs none, or the run is declined, the five run as sub-agents as the brief says, bounded the same way; no round is lost to it.

1. Traceability both ways — does every material commitment in the intent appear in the spec, and does every consequential requirement in the spec trace to the intent or to a line marked [proposed]? List every gap in each direction.
2. Silent additions — does the spec add scope, constraints, implementation choices, dates, budgets, responsibilities, or success measures that the intent did not give, without marking them [proposed]? List each with its line and what in the intent it stretches.
3. Verifiability — for each requirement, can it be verified as the acceptance criteria say (name the criterion, or "uncovered"), and is any threshold or number one the intent did not give? List the uncovered and the invented.
4. Reopened decisions — does the spec reopen, weaken, or contradict a decision the intent states as settled, without naming a specific contradiction, omission, or feasibility concern? An "Areas of concern" entry offering options on a settled point counts unless it names such a concern. List each, quoting both lines.
5. Executability — could someone carry out the work from the spec alone without inventing a consequential requirement? Name each thing they would have to invent or decide, with its section.

Wait for all five. Then work every finding: incorporate what holds,
reject what does not with a one-line reason, and record the round at the
end of `spec.md` as `## Verification round <date> (spec)` — the questions
asked, `Findings: n. Incorporated: n. Rejected: n.`, and each finding's
disposition. One round per document; never re-run.

**In a reconsideration run** the new `spec.md` opens, under its status
line, with a dated `## Reconsidered <date>` changelog — one line per
change: what changed, in which section, why, citing the evidence. A
requirement may change only when `intent.md` changed or the evidence
shows the requirement wrong, and each such line is marked
**requirement change** for the Operator's acceptance; design, concerns,
open questions and acceptance criteria may change freely. The rest of
the file is written whole in the form above; the previous text is not
kept — the register's history holds it. Status: proposed.

## 3. Write `plan.md`

Replace the stub whole (first-time) — or, in a reconsideration run,
rewrite it with the same dated `## Reconsidered <date>` changelog at the
top and **proven work kept proven**: every gate the item's `GATES.md`
shows met is carried with its `EVIDENCE:` line intact and stays checked;
only unmet or abandoned gates are rewritten; new gates are added as
needed; the status line reads "reconsidered <date>; proposed". The plan
is the spec's order of work and its evidence. Form:

```
# Plan: <title>
Status: proposed. From: spec.md <date>. Runs under /unlazy.

## Order of work
1. <step> — needs: <prior steps or nothing>; touches: <paths>; lands
   as: <local commit in the register | part of the project's batch>
2. …

## Gates
- [ ] G1: <outcome of step 1, observable>
  VERIFY: <measurement | inspection | demonstration | review | reference example | automated check>
  CHECK: <command that fails if the outcome is not met>
  EXPECT: <success-only marker>
  EVIDENCE: pending
- [ ] G2: <a manual outcome no command can decide>
  VERIFY: <the review criteria>
  APPROVER: <the approval authority, where established>
  EVIDENCE: pending
- [ ] G2: …
(One gate per acceptance criterion at least; manual gates only where no
command can decide. Every gate names its verification kind in `VERIFY:`
— measurement, inspection, demonstration, review, reference example, or
automated check — and a manual gate its `APPROVER:` where established.
Never a numerical threshold the intent did not give. Lint the ledger:
node <unlazy>/scripts/gate-lint.mjs — it accepts both keys.)

## Batching and governance
<which PR carries what; the register's commits local;
who approves>

## Concerns that block the build
<the spec's areas of concern that must be resolved before step 1>
```

Gates are written to be run with the unlazy checker; copy the `Gates`
section into a `GATES.md` when the build starts. Write the lint result
into the plan's status line.

## 3c. Plan verification round — fresh eyes, once

After the plan is drafted, dispatch **four fresh sub-agents in
parallel**, one question each, given only `spec.md` and `plan.md` and
its question, with the same brief. The four questions, verbatim:

**Where the harness runs workflows**, the four run as one workflow in the same form as the spec's — one agent per question, given `spec.md` and `plan.md`, the same shape and cap, the tier below the session's at an effort the dispatcher sets, the record the session agent's from the journal, sub-agents the fallback. The plan's round is its own run: the plan does not exist when the spec's round runs; both rounds share one run only on a re-run.

1. Coverage both ways — does every acceptance criterion have at least one gate, and does every gate trace to a criterion? List the orphans in each direction.
2. Honest oracles — can each CHECK actually fail? Name any oracle that cannot fail, any EXPECT that copies a supplied number, and any manual gate a command could decide.
3. Order and landing — does each step need only earlier steps, and does every change land where the batching rule allows, nothing shipping alone? List the violations.
4. Ownership and blockers — are the concerns that block the build named before step one, and does any step touch a path outside what the item owns? List each.

Wait for all four; incorporate or reject each finding with a reason;
record `## Verification round <date> (plan)` at the end of `plan.md` with
the counts. One round per document.

## 3b. Ending the previous go (reconsideration only)

A reconsidered spec is proposed, not accepted, and the previous go ends:
clear the item's `in-process`, remove its `working.md` line if present,
and set the item file's status line to "reconsidered <date>; the
previous go ended; awaiting acceptance and a new go". Say so in the
reply.

## 4. Hand back — concerns first

Order of operations: draft `spec.md` → gap round if needed → spec
verification round → incorporate → hand back the spec; draft `plan.md` →
plan verification round → incorporate → hand back both. The hand-back
reports each round's finding count and how many were incorporated, and
names every **requirement change** and every **proposed change to the
intent** before the concerns. Readiness: drafted is not approved;
approved is not ready for execution; "Execution requires separate
authorization."

Reply with the areas of concern first, each with its owner and the
decision it needs; then the requirements in one line each; then where
the files are; then `spec.md` and `plan.md` printed whole and verbatim (reply-form rule), before the offers. In a reconsideration run, name the mode, the changelog
and every **requirement change** before the concerns. Ask the owner to review the spec against the idea: does
it solve the stated problem, and are the intent's open questions
answered or carried forward? **Do not build. Do not start `/unlazy` on
the plan** until the owner accepts the spec — a human makes that call,
consulting a technical lead for anything classed as higher risk. Record
acceptance as a status line change in `spec.md` and `plan.md` — and
stop there. Acceptance is not the go: the build starts only when the
Operator says build or runs `/roadwork-make` (ruling 2026-09-10, after the session agent
built on "spec accepted" alone). End by offering the next step as one invocation in its own code block, preceded by its sentence (offer form)
— `spec accepted and /roadwork-make <ref>`, the acceptance and the go on one line, or `/roadwork-make <ref>` alone once the spec is accepted — as an offer, never by
invoking it (every skill in the chain ends this way: Roadwork conventions).
End with the back offers as `/roadwork-ingest` §5b computes them — up to five, most recent first, as offers only. Then the fact suffix, by the clock (the glossary's **Fact suffix** entry). As a checkbox list where the harness has a question tool, blocks otherwise (the glossary's **Offer form** entry).

After writing: no PR; the register's commits are local.

## Provenance

The spec and plan are logged with the skills and law in force at
writing (their commits). The prompt that produced them is this skill
at the skills' tree's `HEAD`. A non-interactive trigger — a job firing when an
intent is accepted, running this pass with the organization's skills
loaded and committing `spec.md` as a PR — is the intended end state;
until it exists, run this skill by hand.

**Text for the Operator.** In text for the Operator, use the plain words of the terms table — `docs/terms.md` in the register, one row per term: the plain word, the agent's word, the meaning; the agent's words stay in the skill.

## Glossary

- **Roadwork** — the Roadwork system by 2nd Cortex Labs — road plans and the skills that work them.
- **Road plans** — the project's `roadwork/`: the one place its work is recorded. Three **sub-registers**: `todo/` (fixes, chores, decisions, findings), `feature/` (new capabilities), `spark/` (ideas; never worked); the test: a todo is done once, a feature is reused when built — the Operator may name the kind against it.
- **Item** — one folder under its destination's folder in a sub-register (`unnavigated/` until a navigation cites it): `todo.md` or `feature.md` (the **item file**) plus `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`; a spark holds only `idea.md`.
- **Home** — the register an item lives in: the project's one register, at the path the project's law names; a clone of a remote, fetched and merged, never pushed.
- **Reference (ref)** — `todo/<item-name>`, `feature/<item-name>`, `spark/<item-name>`; from anywhere, `main/<kind>/<item-name>` — the project's law may alias the prefix.
- **Frontmatter** — the YAML block opening an item file: `blocker`, `blocking`, `blocked-by`, `external`, `group`, `in-process`, `disposition`, `road-level` (the item's level within its destination — `main`, `secondary`, `side` — or empty), a feature's `onroad-cohort` before it.
- **`ordering.md`** — the register's loose priority list; top is next. **`working.md`** — the register's dated list of items in process.
- **Operator (user)** — the human owner; every decision is theirs.
- **Session agent** — the agent running the session that invokes the skill.
- **Project scope** — everything at and under the root the project's law names; the paths an item touches are its **Paths:** line.
- **Batch** — the coherent bundle a project's changes ship in as one PR; the register's own commits are local and never a PR.
- **Lifecycle** — `/roadwork-destination` → `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` (a destination into a group) → `/roadwork-ingest` → `/roadwork-intentify` → `/roadwork-specplan` → `/roadwork-make` (the only go; builds under `/unlazy`) → `/roadwork-verify-and-archive`. Every skill ends by offering the next. Beside the chain, `/roadwork-help` answers.
- **Area of concern** — a contradiction between policies or an unsatisfiable constraint, recorded with its owner, never resolved silently. **Acceptance** — the Operator accepting the spec; **not a go**.
- **Gate** — one observable outcome with a `CHECK:` command and a success-only `EXPECT:`; the **ledger** is `GATES.md`, run by the unlazy checker.
- **PRD** — a product requirements document, `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`, made by `/roadwork-destination` and the source of a group of items made by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; cited by path in every derived item.
- **Destination** — one `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`: what is wanted, in a fixed form (a frontmatter block with `bucket-list-priority`, 1–10, 10 the highest; the destination, numbered requirements, Out, Success); its slug categorises the register's items — one destination per item, the group's, written on the item by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; archived to `destinations/archive/` by hand when built.
- **Map** — one `maps/<map-slug>.md`: a primitive of the way to a destination — before agents, process, tools, judgements, inputs — in a fixed form, made by `/roadwork-map`; named on an item by its **Map:** line, one per item, read by `/roadwork-intentify` and `/roadwork-specplan`; a pattern to follow or improve, enforced by nothing; retired to `maps/archive/` by hand.
- **Sanity todo** — the todo `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` creates last, `todo/<destination-slug>-sanity`: the group list and the requirement↔item mapping both ways; blocks every other item in the group until the Operator says the group is right.
- **Check types** — the six sanity checks `/roadwork-navsanity` runs over a group: completeness, provenance, shape, dependencies, order, scope.
- **Run** — one pass of `/roadwork-navsanity` over a group: six checks, ten questions, the changes made; recorded as a dated section in the group's sanity todo.
- **Hand-made group** — a group not born of a PRD; its requirements are its members' own claims plus the group's line in `ordering.md`.
- **Cohort** — a subgroup of a group's features that can be built in parallel by sub-agents: the rubric passes on every criterion; named in each member's `onroad-cohort`.
- **Cohortmeister (CM)** — `feature/cm-<group>-<cohort>`: the pseudo-feature that blocks a cohort's members, is onroaded in their place, and whose ledger is the results checker; archives them by cascade.
- **Rubric** — the five pass/fail criteria a subgroup must meet to be a cohort: no dependency edge, disjoint ownership, accepted spec and plan with gates, no external and not in process, self-contained builds.
- **Reconsideration** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s second mode: on an item whose accepted spec and plan already exist, re-read them against everything dated since; a dated `Reconsidered` changelog, proven gates carried, the previous go ended, the spec proposed again.
- **Verification round** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s fresh-eyes check: five predefined questions on the spec, four on the plan, one fresh reader each — run as one workflow where the harness runs workflows, on the top model of the tier one step below the session's (or the session's own where no lower tier exists) at an effort the dispatcher sets, findings in one bounded shape (file, line, one sentence, an empty disposition slot; at most eight; "clean" as none), sub-agents the fallback — findings incorporated or rejected with a reason and recorded in the document by the session agent; one round per document.
- **Back offers** — the second offer line of the four interrupting skills: up to five open lifecycle steps in flight, most recent first, read from the road plans; offers, never invocations; each preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does.
- **Item name** — the kebab-case folder name of an item, chosen at ingest in the Operator's words, and its reference (`todo/<item-name>`, `main/<kind>/<item-name>`); never reused; never a skill name. "Slug" is a generic word, not the register's term; the register names one, a destination's `<destination-slug>`.
- **Batch invocation** — one skill, many references on one line, separated by ` && `; accepted by `/roadwork-verify-and-archive` and `/roadwork-make`, and by `/roadwork-ingest` for a spark batch only (sparks of one home, converting into one item — the bare `/roadwork-spark` lists them grouped), refused by the rest with a reason; offers are printed as invocations in code blocks, related ones combined.
- **Bare call** — a lifecycle skill invoked with no argument lists instead of acting — `/roadwork-spark` the open sparks grouped for conversion, `/roadwork-destination` the destinations with their navigation state, `/roadwork-make` the make-eligible items with their goes and the ineligible with their reasons; a bare call writes nothing.
- **Offer form** — every command or phrase a reply suggests the Operator type is printed in its own fenced code block (three backticks, no language tag), nothing else in the block, one per block, so it copies in one gesture; invocations that run as one line — a batch invocation with ` && ` — share one block; prose around the block says what it does; an offered invocation is preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does. The copy a skill carries for use outside a workspace; in a workspace the reply-form rule holds it. Where the harness has a question tool, the offers of a hand-back are one list of choices — each the invocation with its sentence — plus "none of these" and a free-text choice; a tick is the Operator's word, run in the same turn; blocks where there is no tool. Where an offer waits on the Operator's word, the block — or the choice's label — carries both, `<word> and <invocation>`; the word is recorded as the Operator's, dated, before the invocation runs.
- **Fact suffix** — after the last offer of a lifecycle hand-back, when the machine's minute is a multiple of six: two blank lines, then the title line "A 2ndcortex/roadmap system detail you should know about:" plain, then one fact from `docs/facts.md`, picked by the seconds modulo the count of its numbered facts — never a heading, then "Typing this explains it:" and `/roadwork-help <term>` in its own code block; never after `/roadwork-help`; no state, no script.
- **Tasksplit** — `/roadwork-tasksplit <source>`: any document or list into a dated group of todos, one per unit the source delineates, the source's words verbatim and no reading added; no sanity todo, no cohort.
