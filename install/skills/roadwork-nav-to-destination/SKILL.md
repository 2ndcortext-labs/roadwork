name: roadwork-nav-to-destination
description: Navigates to one destination — turns destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md (made by /roadwork-destination) into a group of road plans items: reads back the decomposition once, files every feature and todo through /roadwork-ingest's form with the destination cited by path and written on each item, sets the group name, writes the group's block in ordering.md, and creates the sanity todo last so the Operator validates the group before anything in it starts. Takes only a destination slug; a path, a pasted document or nothing is refused with the offer of /roadwork-destination. Use when the user says /roadwork-nav-to-destination <destination-slug>, "navigate to this destination", "break this destination into items". Never builds. For a task list or any other document whose units are already todos, `/roadwork-tasksplit`.

# roadwork-nav-to-destination — a destination becomes a trustworthy group of items

Roadwork conventions: this skill's glossary; in a workspace, its rules file as well (the Destinations
bullet). Input: only a destination slug — the destination is
`destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md` in the register's
`destinations/`, made by
`/roadwork-destination`. Anything else — a path, a pasted document, no
argument — is refused in one line, with the offer of `/roadwork-destination
<slug>` (which saves a document as `destinations/<slug>.source.md` and
interviews it into a destination). Output: a
group of items, a block in `ordering.md`, and a sanity todo. "Always
creates a sanity todo … to allow operater to validate prd group"
(Operator, 2026-09-10).

## 1. Read the destination

A batch (`ref && ref`) is refused here: one destination at a time; a
non-slug argument refused as above.

Read it whole. Its requirements are its numbered list (the fixed form
`/roadwork-destination` writes); where a destination made by hand lacks one,
number them yourself and say so. A
requirement is one thing the programme must deliver or must not do.

## 2. Decompose

One item per coherent deliverable: a new capability is a **feature**; a
fix, chore, decision to take, or finding to trace is a **todo** (the road plans test (the glossary's **Road plans** entry): done once, or reused when built). For each
item: title in the PRD's words, kind, the paths it is relevant to ("ord seeds
whatever it is relevant to" — its Paths line, where the PRD names them), the requirement numbers it
covers, and its dependencies on other items where the PRD's own ordering
words imply them. Where an existing open item already covers a
requirement, cite it instead of filing a duplicate. Where the paths are in
doubt, mark the item "paths: ask" — "can confirm with operator if any
doubt".

## 3. Read back — once

One message: the numbered requirements as you read them; the proposed
items (title, kind, home, requirement numbers, dependencies); the
proposed order; every "home: ask" as a question with your
recommendation; then the two questions — anything to add to the notes?
any comments on the reading? Wait once. Fold what comes back ("answers
not required"); a "no" or silence means proceed as proposed.

Close with three blocks in this order: `go with recos` — nothing to add,
proceed as proposed; `go with recos except:` — proceed except as listed
after the colon; `no, no` — the pair alone, the proposals answered by
hand.

## 4. File every item through `/roadwork-ingest`

For each item, in dependency order, follow `/roadwork-ingest` §1–§4 exactly (the
one item form; this skill adds nothing to it), with:

- notes = the destination's words for that item, verbatim, opened by the
  citation: `From <home>/destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md,
  requirements <n, n>:` ("prd doc name with path included in every
  derived feature and todo");
- the line **Destination:** `<destination-slug>` under the item's owner
  line — the item's one destination, the group's; no frontmatter key;
- the line **Map:** `<map-slug>` under it when the destination names one —
  inherited by every item of the group; no frontmatter key;
- the filer's reading and the numbered "not decided" list as `/roadwork-ingest` requires;
- frontmatter: `group: [<destination-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>]` (today's date;
  one group per destination), `road-level` (`main`, `secondary` or `side` — the item's level within the destination, the session agent's reading of the requirement's weight, put in the read-back of §3 for the Operator's correction, changeable by hand after),`blocked-by` = the items it depends on **plus the
  sanity todo's reference** (filled in at step 6), `blocking` on the
  other side, `blocker` re-derived;
- The item file carries its `**Paths:**` line as `/roadwork-ingest` §3 gives it, when the source names paths.
- the item's folder under `<kind>/<destination-slug>/`; an existing item cited from `unnavigated/` — or from another destination's folder, on the Operator's word [proposed: a re-navigation's move, the same act] — is moved there in the same act, by `git mv`, history kept.

A navigation should generally exist immediately after a destination is established. Where unnavigated items exist — filed before the navigation existed — they should helpfully inform the navigation, to a degree: read them for the requirements they already answer, cite them, never file them twice (the Operator, 2026-09-18).

## 5. The block in `ordering.md`

In the register's `ordering.md`, one line for the sanity todo, carrying
the destination (`— destination: <destination-slug>`), with the group's
indented block beneath it — the items in execution order
(dependencies first, then `road-level` — `main` before `secondary` before `side` — then your judgment, parallel items adjacent; the block among the other destinations' by `bucket-list-priority` descending, informing the judgement that places it) — placed
whole where you judge the programme belongs. "Section in ordering.md to order group
execution."

## 6. The sanity todo — created last

`todo/<destination-slug>-sanity` in the destination's home, filed through `/roadwork-ingest` with
notes = the group list; its `todo.md` carries, after the notes:

- **Group:** every reference with kind and home.
- **Requirement → item:** each numbered requirement and the item(s)
  covering it, or "deliberately dropped: <why>".
- **Item → requirements:** each item and its numbers.
- **Checklist** (for `/roadwork-navsanity` and the Operator): completeness —
  every requirement covered or dropped on purpose; no item without a source;
  kinds and homes right; dependencies consistent (both sides agree, no
  cycle, nothing points up); order workable; group name on every member.

Frontmatter: `group` the same; `road-level: main`; `blocking` = every other item in the
group; `blocker: yes`. Then write the sanity todo's reference into every
other item's `blocked-by`. It archives only on the Operator's word, through
`/roadwork-verify-and-archive`; "sanity check also for completness" — `/roadwork-navsanity` works
it. Nothing in the group starts before it is verified and archived.

## 7. Commit and hand back

Commit in the register (its commits local). Reply with: the destination's path; the group name; the group list
with kinds and homes; the requirement → item mapping's gaps, if any; the
block's place in `ordering.md`; the sanity todo's reference. End with the
offer, one invocation in its own code block, preceded by its sentence (offer form), never invoked: `/roadwork-navsanity <group>` (until that
skill exists: the Operator reads the sanity todo and archives it by
`/roadwork-verify-and-archive`), and the top-most unblocked item in `ordering.md` with its
skill as the next logical item now. Then the fact suffix, by the clock (the glossary's **Fact suffix** entry). As a checkbox list where the harness has a question tool, blocks otherwise (the glossary's **Offer form** entry).

The specs this skill writes follow `/roadwork-specplan` §0a — the
Operator's spec-writing guidelines — and get its verification rounds.

## Never

Never build; never interview beyond the one read-back (each item's
`/roadwork-intentify` is its own); never file an item outside `/roadwork-ingest`'s form;
never read a PRD from anywhere but `destinations/`; never make or amend a destination (that is `/roadwork-destination`); never create the sanity todo
first; never archive, move, or strike anything; never open a PR.

**Text for the Operator.** In text for the Operator, use the plain words of the terms table — `docs/terms.md` in the register, one row per term: the plain word, the agent's word, the meaning; the agent's words stay in the skill.

## Glossary

- **Roadwork** — the Roadwork system by 2nd Cortex Labs — road plans and the skills that work them.
- **Road plans** — the project's `roadwork/`: the one place its work is recorded. Three **sub-registers**: `todo/` (fixes, chores, decisions, findings), `feature/` (new capabilities), `spark/` (ideas; never worked); the test: a todo is done once, a feature is reused when built — the Operator may name the kind against it.
- **Item** — one folder under its destination's folder in a sub-register (`unnavigated/` until a navigation cites it): `todo.md` or `feature.md` (the **item file**) plus `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`; a spark holds only `idea.md`.
- **Home** — the register an item lives in: the project's one register, at the path the project's law names; a clone of a remote, fetched and merged, never pushed.
- **Reference (ref)** — `todo/<item-name>`, `feature/<item-name>`, `spark/<item-name>`; from anywhere, `main/<kind>/<item-name>` — the project's law may alias the prefix.
- **Frontmatter** — the YAML block opening an item file: `blocker`, `blocking`, `blocked-by`, `external`, `group`, `in-process`, `disposition`, `road-level` (the item's level within its destination — `main`, `secondary`, `side` — or empty), a feature's `onroad-cohort` before it.
- **`ordering.md`** — the register's loose priority list; top is next. **`working.md`** — the register's dated list of items in process.
- **Operator (user)** — the human owner; every decision is theirs.
- **Session agent** — the agent running the session that invokes the skill.
- **Project scope** — everything at and under the root the project's law names; the paths an item touches are its **Paths:** line.
- **Batch** — the coherent bundle a project's changes ship in as one PR; the register's own commits are local and never a PR.
- **Lifecycle** — `/roadwork-destination` → `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` (a destination into a group) → `/roadwork-ingest` → `/roadwork-intentify` → `/roadwork-specplan` → `/roadwork-make` (the only go; builds under `/unlazy`) → `/roadwork-verify-and-archive`. Every skill ends by offering the next. Beside the chain, `/roadwork-help` answers.
- **PRD** — a product requirements document, `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`, made by `/roadwork-destination` and the source of a group of items made by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; cited by path in every derived item.
- **Destination** — one `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`: what is wanted, in a fixed form (a frontmatter block with `bucket-list-priority`, 1–10, 10 the highest; the destination, numbered requirements, Out, Success); its slug categorises the register's items — one destination per item, the group's, written on the item by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; archived to `destinations/archive/` by hand when built.
- **Map** — one `maps/<map-slug>.md`: a primitive of the way to a destination — before agents, process, tools, judgements, inputs — in a fixed form, made by `/roadwork-map`; named on an item by its **Map:** line, one per item, read by `/roadwork-intentify` and `/roadwork-specplan`; a pattern to follow or improve, enforced by nothing; retired to `maps/archive/` by hand.
- **Sanity todo** — the todo `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` creates last, `todo/<destination-slug>-sanity`: the group list and the requirement↔item mapping both ways; blocks every other item in the group until the Operator says the group is right.
- **Check types** — the six sanity checks `/roadwork-navsanity` runs over a group: completeness, provenance, shape, dependencies, order, scope.
- **Run** — one pass of `/roadwork-navsanity` over a group: six checks, ten questions, the changes made; recorded as a dated section in the group's sanity todo.
- **Hand-made group** — a group not born of a PRD; its requirements are its members' own claims plus the group's line in `ordering.md`.
- **Cohort** — a subgroup of a group's features that can be built in parallel by sub-agents: the rubric passes on every criterion; named in each member's `onroad-cohort`.
- **Cohortmeister (CM)** — `feature/cm-<group>-<cohort>`: the pseudo-feature that blocks a cohort's members, is onroaded in their place, and whose ledger is the results checker; archives them by cascade.
- **Rubric** — the five pass/fail criteria a subgroup must meet to be a cohort: no dependency edge, disjoint ownership, accepted spec and plan with gates, no external and not in process, self-contained builds.
- **Reconsideration** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s second mode: on an item whose accepted spec and plan already exist, re-read them against everything dated since; a dated `Reconsidered` changelog, proven gates carried, the previous go ended, the spec proposed again.
- **Verification round** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s fresh-eyes check: five predefined questions on the spec, four on the plan, one fresh reader each — run as one workflow where the harness runs workflows, on the top model of the tier one step below the session's (or the session's own where no lower tier exists) at an effort the dispatcher sets, findings in one bounded shape (file, line, one sentence, an empty disposition slot; at most eight; "clean" as none), sub-agents the fallback — findings incorporated or rejected with a reason and recorded in the document by the session agent; one round per document.
- **Back offers** — the second offer line of the four interrupting skills: up to five open lifecycle steps in flight, most recent first, read from the road plans; offers, never invocations; each preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does.
- **Item name** — the kebab-case folder name of an item, chosen at ingest in the Operator's words, and its reference (`todo/<item-name>`, `main/<kind>/<item-name>`); never reused; never a skill name. "Slug" is a generic word, not the register's term; the register names one, a destination's `<destination-slug>`.
- **Batch invocation** — one skill, many references on one line, separated by ` && `; accepted by `/roadwork-verify-and-archive` and `/roadwork-make`, and by `/roadwork-ingest` for a spark batch only (sparks of one home, converting into one item — the bare `/roadwork-spark` lists them grouped), refused by the rest with a reason; offers are printed as invocations in code blocks, related ones combined.
- **Bare call** — a lifecycle skill invoked with no argument lists instead of acting — `/roadwork-spark` the open sparks grouped for conversion, `/roadwork-destination` the destinations with their navigation state, `/roadwork-make` the make-eligible items with their goes and the ineligible with their reasons; a bare call writes nothing.
- **Offer form** — every command or phrase a reply suggests the Operator type is printed in its own fenced code block (three backticks, no language tag), nothing else in the block, one per block, so it copies in one gesture; invocations that run as one line — a batch invocation with ` && ` — share one block; prose around the block says what it does; an offered invocation is preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does. The copy a skill carries for use outside a workspace; in a workspace the reply-form rule holds it. Where the harness has a question tool, the offers of a hand-back are one list of choices — each the invocation with its sentence — plus "none of these" and a free-text choice; a tick is the Operator's word, run in the same turn; blocks where there is no tool. Where an offer waits on the Operator's word, the block — or the choice's label — carries both, `<word> and <invocation>`; the word is recorded as the Operator's, dated, before the invocation runs.
- **Fact suffix** — after the last offer of a lifecycle hand-back, when the machine's minute is a multiple of six: two blank lines, then the title line "A 2ndcortex/roadmap system detail you should know about:" plain, then one fact from `docs/facts.md`, picked by the seconds modulo the count of its numbered facts — never a heading, then "Typing this explains it:" and `/roadwork-help <term>` in its own code block; never after `/roadwork-help`; no state, no script.
- **Tasksplit** — `/roadwork-tasksplit <source>`: any document or list into a dated group of todos, one per unit the source delineates, the source's words verbatim and no reading added; no sanity todo, no cohort.
