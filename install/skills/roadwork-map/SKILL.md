name: roadwork-map
description: Makes, updates or receives a map — one maps/<map-slug>.md, a primitive of the way to a destination (before agents, process, tools, judgements, inputs) in a fixed form. Bare, it lists the maps with the count of open items naming each; with <new-slug> <description> it interviews in /roadwork-intentify's pattern and writes the file on confirm; with <existing-slug> it reads the file back and rewrites it whole with a dated changelog line; with a pasted document or a path it saves the document verbatim as maps/<slug>.source.md and interviews from it. Use when the user says /roadwork-map, "new map", "how do we get there", "here is how we used to do it", "update the map". Never enforces a map, never files an item, never builds.

# roadwork-map — a map, made with the Operator

Roadwork conventions: this skill's glossary; in a workspace, its rules file as well (the
Maps bullet). A map is one file, `maps/<map-slug>.md`, in the register's
`maps/`. It is a primitive of the
way to a destination: what process, what tools, what judgements, what
inputs — and, most helpfully, how it was done before agents were in the
picture. A destination says what is wanted; a map says how it is reached.
`/roadwork-intentify` and `/roadwork-specplan` read the map an item names;
no skill enforces one. A retired map moves to `maps/archive/` by hand;
there is no archive skill.

## 1. Resolve the invocation

A batch (`ref && ref`) is refused here: one map at a time.

- **bare** (no argument): the list of §2. Writes nothing.
- **`<new-slug> <initial description>`**: a kebab-case slug not yet in
  `maps/` or `maps/archive/` of any home (a slug is never reused), followed
  by the Operator's words — the interview of §3, the file of §4.
- **`<existing-slug>`**: a slug already in `maps/` — the update of §4.
- **`<new-slug>` with a document** — a pasted document in the message, or a
  path to one: the entrance of §5, then the interview shortened.
- **a document with no slug**, or a path alone: propose a slug in the
  Operator's words and ask once; on their word proceed as above.

## 2. The bare call — the maps

Read the register's `maps/` — `archive/` excluded — and print a count line
(`maps: <n>`) and then one line per map: its slug, its opening
words (the map's own), and the count of open items whose
**Map:** line names it. No navigation state: a map is never done. With no
map in any home — the empty case — print the counts and the offer to start
one, `/roadwork-map <new-slug> <description>`. A bare call writes nothing.

## 3. The interview — the intentify pattern

Read back the Operator's description as given (verbatim), then your
reading of it, marked as yours, and ask the two questions — anything to
add? any comments on the reading? Then the rounds of `/roadwork-intentify`
§2, closed as `/roadwork-intentify` §2 closes a round: the design tree, the frontier asked whole each round, every question
numbered with your recommendation, the facts found by you, never asked;
the decisions the Operator's. The root branches for a map:

- **The destination it reaches** — which destination, or kind of
  destination, this is the way to; in one paragraph.
- **Before agents** — how it was done by hand, by whom, with what record.
- **Process** — the steps in order.
- **Tools** — what the steps use and rely on.
- **Judgements** — the calls a person makes along the way, and on what.
- **Inputs** — what the way starts from and consumes.
- **Crossings** — open items, destinations and other maps this one
  touches; read, never written into.

Stop when the frontier is empty; say so and ask the Operator to confirm. Offer `confirm and /roadwork-intentify <ref>` in its own block — the reference §6 would offer — and `confirm` in another, or `confirm` alone when §6 would offer none; on the pair, write the file as on `confirm` alone, then run the interview skill in the same turn.
Do not write the file until they confirm.

## 4. Write the map — the fixed form

On confirm, `maps/<map-slug>.md` in the owning home, in this form and no
other:

```
# Map: <title in the Operator's words>
_Map, made <date> by /roadwork-map; open until retired._

<the destination it reaches: one paragraph>

## Before agents
<how it was done by hand>

## Process
1. <step>
2. …

## Tools
<a paragraph or a list>

## Judgements
<a paragraph or a list>

## Inputs
<a paragraph or a list>

## Changelog
- <date>: made.
```

**An update** (`<existing-slug>`): read the file back whole, ask what
changes and interview only that, then rewrite the file whole on confirm
and append one dated line under `## Changelog` saying what changed. The
Process keeps its numbers; a dropped step is struck ("~~n.~~ dropped
<date>: <why>"), never renumbered, so that plans citing steps stay true.

## 5. A document arrives

When the Operator pastes a document or names a path — a procedure written
elsewhere, a runbook, a page of notes on how it used to be done — save it
first, verbatim, as `maps/<map-slug>.source.md` in the owning home (a
header line above it: `_Source of <map-slug>, received <date>; verbatim._`).
Then the interview of §3, shortened to what the source leaves open: read
back your reading of the source into the six parts, ask the two
questions, then only the rounds the gaps need. The map is written as §4;
its first changelog line names the source. The source file stays beside
it and moves with it to `archive/`.

## 6. Commit and hand back

Commit in the register (its commits local). Reply with: the map's path
(and the source's, if any); its title and the count of its Process steps;
the crossings found; then the map printed whole and verbatim, before the offers (reply-form rule). End with the offer, one invocation in its own code
block, preceded by its sentence (offer form), never invoked: the top-most
open item, not in process, whose file names a destination the map's
opening paragraph names —

```
/roadwork-intentify <ref>
```

— else no offer. Then the back offers as `/roadwork-ingest` §5b computes
them — up to five, most recent first, as offers only. Then the fact suffix, by the clock (the glossary's **Fact suffix** entry). As a checkbox list where the harness has a question tool, blocks otherwise (the glossary's **Offer form** entry).

## Never

Never enforce a map (no skill checks one); never file, interview or spec
an item (those are the chain's); never write into an item, a destination
or another map; never renumber a step; never write a map the Operator did
not confirm; never archive or move a map; never a frontmatter key on any
item; never open a PR.

**Text for the Operator.** In text for the Operator, use the plain words of the terms table — `docs/terms.md` in the register, one row per term: the plain word, the agent's word, the meaning; the agent's words stay in the skill.

## Glossary

- **Roadwork** — the Roadwork system by 2nd Cortex Labs — road plans and the skills that work them.
- **Road plans** — the project's `roadwork/`: the one place its work is recorded. Three **sub-registers**: `todo/` (fixes, chores, decisions, findings), `feature/` (new capabilities), `spark/` (ideas; never worked); the test: a todo is done once, a feature is reused when built — the Operator may name the kind against it.
- **Item** — one folder under its destination's folder in a sub-register (`unnavigated/` until a navigation cites it): `todo.md` or `feature.md` (the **item file**) plus `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`; a spark holds only `idea.md`.
- **Home** — the register an item lives in: the project's one register, at the path the project's law names; a clone of a remote, fetched and merged, never pushed.
- **Reference (ref)** — `todo/<item-name>`, `feature/<item-name>`, `spark/<item-name>`; from anywhere, `main/<kind>/<item-name>` — the project's law may alias the prefix.
- **Frontmatter** — the YAML block opening an item file: `blocker`, `blocking`, `blocked-by`, `external`, `group`, `in-process`, `disposition`, `road-level` (the item's level within its destination — `main`, `secondary`, `side` — or empty), a feature's `onroad-cohort` before it.
- **`ordering.md`** — the register's loose priority list; top is next. **`working.md`** — the register's dated list of items in process.
- **Operator (user)** — the human owner; every decision is theirs.
- **Session agent** — the agent running the session that invokes the skill.
- **Project scope** — everything at and under the root the project's law names; the paths an item touches are its **Paths:** line.
- **Batch** — the coherent bundle a project's changes ship in as one PR; the register's own commits are local and never a PR.
- **Lifecycle** — `/roadwork-destination` → `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` (a destination into a group) → `/roadwork-ingest` → `/roadwork-intentify` → `/roadwork-specplan` → `/roadwork-make` (the only go; builds under `/unlazy`) → `/roadwork-verify-and-archive`. Every skill ends by offering the next. Beside the chain, `/roadwork-help` answers.
- **PRD** — a product requirements document, `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`, made by `/roadwork-destination` and the source of a group of items made by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; cited by path in every derived item.
- **Destination** — one `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`: what is wanted, in a fixed form (a frontmatter block with `bucket-list-priority`, 1–10, 10 the highest; the destination, numbered requirements, Out, Success); its slug categorises the register's items — one destination per item, the group's, written on the item by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; archived to `destinations/archive/` by hand when built.
- **Map** — one `maps/<map-slug>.md`: a primitive of the way to a destination — before agents, process, tools, judgements, inputs — in a fixed form, made by `/roadwork-map`; named on an item by its **Map:** line, one per item, read by `/roadwork-intentify` and `/roadwork-specplan`; a pattern to follow or improve, enforced by nothing; retired to `maps/archive/` by hand.
- **Sanity todo** — the todo `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` creates last, `todo/<destination-slug>-sanity`: the group list and the requirement↔item mapping both ways; blocks every other item in the group until the Operator says the group is right.
- **Check types** — the six sanity checks `/roadwork-navsanity` runs over a group: completeness, provenance, shape, dependencies, order, scope.
- **Run** — one pass of `/roadwork-navsanity` over a group: six checks, ten questions, the changes made; recorded as a dated section in the group's sanity todo.
- **Hand-made group** — a group not born of a PRD; its requirements are its members' own claims plus the group's line in `ordering.md`.
- **Cohort** — a subgroup of a group's features that can be built in parallel by sub-agents: the rubric passes on every criterion; named in each member's `onroad-cohort`.
- **Cohortmeister (CM)** — `feature/cm-<group>-<cohort>`: the pseudo-feature that blocks a cohort's members, is onroaded in their place, and whose ledger is the results checker; archives them by cascade.
- **Rubric** — the five pass/fail criteria a subgroup must meet to be a cohort: no dependency edge, disjoint ownership, accepted spec and plan with gates, no external and not in process, self-contained builds.
- **Reconsideration** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s second mode: on an item whose accepted spec and plan already exist, re-read them against everything dated since; a dated `Reconsidered` changelog, proven gates carried, the previous go ended, the spec proposed again.
- **Verification round** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s fresh-eyes check: five predefined questions on the spec, four on the plan, one fresh reader each — run as one workflow where the harness runs workflows, on the top model of the tier one step below the session's (or the session's own where no lower tier exists) at an effort the dispatcher sets, findings in one bounded shape (file, line, one sentence, an empty disposition slot; at most eight; "clean" as none), sub-agents the fallback — findings incorporated or rejected with a reason and recorded in the document by the session agent; one round per document.
- **Back offers** — the second offer line of the four interrupting skills: up to five open lifecycle steps in flight, most recent first, read from the road plans; offers, never invocations; each preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does.
- **Item name** — the kebab-case folder name of an item, chosen at ingest in the Operator's words, and its reference (`todo/<item-name>`, `main/<kind>/<item-name>`); never reused; never a skill name. "Slug" is a generic word, not the register's term; the register names one, a destination's `<destination-slug>`.
- **Batch invocation** — one skill, many references on one line, separated by ` && `; accepted by `/roadwork-verify-and-archive` and `/roadwork-make`, and by `/roadwork-ingest` for a spark batch only (sparks of one home, converting into one item — the bare `/roadwork-spark` lists them grouped), refused by the rest with a reason; offers are printed as invocations in code blocks, related ones combined.
- **Bare call** — a lifecycle skill invoked with no argument lists instead of acting — `/roadwork-spark` the open sparks grouped for conversion, `/roadwork-destination` the destinations with their navigation state, `/roadwork-make` the make-eligible items with their goes and the ineligible with their reasons; a bare call writes nothing.
- **Offer form** — every command or phrase a reply suggests the Operator type is printed in its own fenced code block (three backticks, no language tag), nothing else in the block, one per block, so it copies in one gesture; invocations that run as one line — a batch invocation with ` && ` — share one block; prose around the block says what it does; an offered invocation is preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does. The copy a skill carries for use outside a workspace; in a workspace the reply-form rule holds it. Where the harness has a question tool, the offers of a hand-back are one list of choices — each the invocation with its sentence — plus "none of these" and a free-text choice; a tick is the Operator's word, run in the same turn; blocks where there is no tool. Where an offer waits on the Operator's word, the block — or the choice's label — carries both, `<word> and <invocation>`; the word is recorded as the Operator's, dated, before the invocation runs.
- **Fact suffix** — after the last offer of a lifecycle hand-back, when the machine's minute is a multiple of six: two blank lines, then the title line "A 2ndcortex/roadmap system detail you should know about:" plain, then one fact from `docs/facts.md`, picked by the seconds modulo the count of its numbered facts — never a heading, then "Typing this explains it:" and `/roadwork-help <term>` in its own code block; never after `/roadwork-help`; no state, no script.
- **Tasksplit** — `/roadwork-tasksplit <source>`: any document or list into a dated group of todos, one per unit the source delineates, the source's words verbatim and no reading added; no sanity todo, no cohort.
