The Roadwork register — the one place a project's work is recorded. Three
sibling sub-registers: `todo/` (fixes, chores, decisions to take, findings to
trace; item file `todo.md`), `feature/` (new capabilities; item file
`feature.md`), `spark/` (ideas for later; `idea.md` only). Each holds one
folder per item, kebab-case item name, never reused, and its own `archive/`.
Beside them, `docs/`, `destinations/` and `maps/`, each with its archive.
`ordering.md` is the living, loose prioritization — one ordered list, top is
next, maintained by agent judgment; the basis for "what should we do next?".
`working.md` records the items in process (dated list, not a history). The
base-case workflow, in order: `/roadwork-ingest` files (notes verbatim, the filer's reading, placeholders,
frontmatter) → `/roadwork-intentify` interviews → `/roadwork-specplan` writes spec and
plan with gates → `/roadwork-make` is the Operator's go and builds under `/unlazy`
→ `/roadwork-verify-and-archive` archives. An accepted spec is not a go. One
register per project, at the path the project's law names; no path under the
project carries one of its own. This folder is a clone of a remote Roadwork
repository: fetched from and merged, never pushed to, its commits local; the
remote ships the skeleton with its anchors, the docs, the rule and the skills,
never a map and never an item. Roadwork register law: the rule
`.claude/rules/roadwork-register.md`, the remote's.
